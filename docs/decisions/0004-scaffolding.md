# Solution and Feature Scaffolding

## Context and Problem Statement

Ideally, the starter kit should behave like a restaurant.  There is basic service that you'd expect when you sit down at the table, which is the overall solution with core modules.  Then you choose what you'd like based on your tastes and appetite.  This is where module scaffolding comes into play.  These are the features and project modules to use Helix terminology.  The scaffolding 'engine' that we create is the kitchen and we need it to operate efficiently in order for our restaurant to succeed.  

**This is where most of the contributions will happen in the starter kit, so it will need to be intuitive.**

## Decision Drivers

* Low barrier to entry
* Small learning curve
* Testability
* Documentation / Community Support

## Considered Options

* [PlopJS](https://plopjs.com/)
* [dotnet CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | â€¦ | comes out best (see below)}.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### PlopJS

#### Pro

* :heavy_check_mark: A team subset has experience with this tool.
* :heavy_check_mark: Simple and easy to use
* :heavy_check_mark: Very flexible
