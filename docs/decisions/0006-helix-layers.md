# Helix Layering Pattern

## Context and Problem Statement

Helix is a common pattern within traditional Sitecore MVC implementations.  The primary goals are: reusability and maintainability across solutions.  With the separation of UI code from backend Sitecore code, this pattern offers less value.

Do we want to continue using Helix within the backend solution?

## Decision Drivers

These items are taken from the Sitecore [knowledge center](https://www.sitecore.com/knowledge-center/blog/511/introducing-sitecore-helix-4380) around Helix

* Quality
* Speed to Market
* Long-term value
* Sitecore-supported methodology
* Conventional development practices
* Shareability & Reusability

## Considered Options

* Helix Pattern
* Traditional n-tier architecture

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | â€¦ | comes out best (see below)}.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Helix Pattern
